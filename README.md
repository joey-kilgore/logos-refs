## Setup notes
1. Make sure community plugins are turned on, and install the logos-refs plugin
2. Under the logos-refs settings, set your reference directory (I like having a `refs` folder)
3. In Logos, under program settings, set citation style to `BibTeX Style`
4. You are ready to go!

## Development
This plugin is under continuous and rapid development. All bugs and feature requests should be filed under the [Issues](https://github.com/joey-kilgore/logos-refs/issues) in this repo.
